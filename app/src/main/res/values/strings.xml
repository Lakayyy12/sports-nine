<string name="about">Publications on statistical models for football forecasts began in the 1990s, however Moroney developed the first model far earlier, in 1956, when he published his first statistical study of soccer match results. Both the Poisson distribution and the negative binomial distribution fit the results of football games, according to his analysis. Reep and Benjamin successfully used negative binomial distribution to examine the series of ball passing between players during football matches in 1968. They enhanced this strategy in 1971, and Hill demonstrated in 1974 that soccer game outcomes can be predicted and are not only determined by chance.

    <string name="about1">Michael Maher created the first model for forecasting the outcomes of football matches between teams of varying ability levels in 1982. The goals scored by the opponents during the game are drawn from the Poisson distribution, according to his hypothesis. The model parameters are established by the differential in offensive and defensive skills, which is adjusted for home field advantage. Caurneya and Carron described the strategies for modeling the home field advantage factor in a 1992 publication. Knorr-Held investigated the time-dependence of team strengths in 1999. He ranked football teams using a recursive Bayesian estimate, which was more accurate than traditional average data soccer prediction.</string>

    <string name="gd5">Statistics-based football betting system</string>

    <string name="gd01"> All prediction algorithms can be classified based on tournament type, time dependency, and regression methodology. Football prediction systems differ between round-robin and knockout competitions. Diego Kuonens article summarizes the methods for Knockout competition.</string>
<string name="gd02">This system attempts to assign a continually scaled rating value to each team in the event, with the strongest team receiving the highest rating. The method assumes that the rating assigned to rival teams is proportional to the outcome of each match.</string>
<string name="gd03">Arbitrage betting is the simplest and most consistent betting approach for generating a guaranteed return on football. This betting strategy is centered on identifying incorrect odds that do not represent the true possibility of the outcome and covering the opposite outcome on sharp, correct odds.</string>
<string name="gd04">Arbitrage betting and value betting are both based on the same basic principle and method. As smart bettors, our goal is to locate markets on football matches where bookmakers are offering incorrect odds.
This means that they are giving odds that are greater than the true likelihood of winning. You should wager on such betting opportunities whenever you come across them.</string>
<string name="gd05">Bookmakers calculate odds using a database of prior data and every accessible piece of information. The amount of information that bookies receive varies.
Winning football bets based on statistics is only achievable if you can show that your understanding of the game and players is superior.
Bookmakers lack the resources to react to every new trend and piece of information for every available match. Following the game live could provide you an advantage in football betting. Taking action while the bookmaker is slow.</string>
